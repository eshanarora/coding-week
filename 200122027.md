## Intersts 
Although I am very new to the coding world I have my interest in the following domains
- **Web Devlopment**: I have had some basic knowledge of frontend and currently I am working on my backend skills.
- **Machine Learning**: I have a great interest in machine learning and AI and look to master this domain in the future.




Apart from intererst I would like to learn something in each domain.
So I hope I can join you guys and learn a lot being in the club.
